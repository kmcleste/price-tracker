![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/kmcleste/price-tracker?style=flat-square)

The goal of this project is to function as a basic price tracking API - while also teaching the fundamentals of deploying a full stack project to the cloud.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: poetry, pyenv, pre-commit

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kmcleste/price-tracker
    cd price-tracker
    ```

2. Initialize the project:

    ```bash
    make repo-init
    ```

    This script will install all of the necessary dependencies using poetry, then it will install the pre-commit hooks.
